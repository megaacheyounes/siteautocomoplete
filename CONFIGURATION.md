## Setting up the Huawei Account in AppGallery

During this step, you will create an app in AppGallery Connect (AGC) of HUAWEI Developer. When creating the app, you will need to enter the app name, app category, default language, and signing certificate fingerprint. After the app has been created, you will be able to obtain the basic configurations for the app, for example, the app ID and app secret, which will then be used in subsequent development activities.

- Sign in to HUAWEI Developer and click Console.

  <summary>Generating a Signing Certificate</summary>

## Generating a Signing Certificate

During this step, you will create a new signature file in Android Studio, which will be used for generating the SHA-256 fingerprint for your app.

- In the menu bar of the Android Studio project that you have created, go to Build>Generate Signed Bundle/APK...

![Image description](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/codelab/HMSPreparation/img/f8bb026ba4fe94b8.png)

- On the Generate Signed Bundle or APK page, select APK and click Next.

  <summary>Generating a Signing Certificate Fingerprint</summary>

## Generating a Signing Certificate Fingerprint

During this step, you will need to export the SHA-256 fingerprint by using keytool provided by the JDK and signature file.

- Open the command window and access the bin directory where the JDK is installed.
  ![Image description](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/codelab/HMSPreparation/img/3133f0cb0cd01718.png)

- Run the following keytool command in the bin directory and enter the password for the signature file key. This password was specified when the signature file was created.

`keytool -list -v -keystore D:\Android\WorkSpcae\HmsDemo\app\HmsDemo.jks`
